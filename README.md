# Emotion-Mining-with-NLTK
  First, a small base of multiple sentences with their emotions/classes was used. In this algorithm, the nltk algorithm was implemented in pre-processing and to  implement the Naive Beyes algorithm.
  The emotions that are featured in each sentence are based on the study of the main human emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, surprise, disgust and anger) by Paul Ekman.

#### 1.Data Preprocessing
Pre-processing is a crucial step for any data analysis and when it comes to text mining, the steps are essential in order for the Naive Bayes algorithm to behave correctly.
  
  1) Eliminate stopwords;

##### Removal of very common words in sentence structures but which do not have a relevant meaning for the analysis
  
  2) Extract the root of the word (Stemming);

  3) Remove words that are repeated in order to reduce the dimensionality of the table that will be created by naive beyes;

  4) Remove rating from each sentence;

  5) Extraction of words from all sentences to check that you are recognizing the words in the sentence;
  
  
#### 2.About the Naive Beyes Algorithm

#### 3.Algorithm Evaluation

Need to see the performance and whether it can already be implemented in the commercial environment.

How it was implemented:
-Use a classifier evaluation
-Use a larger database
-Separate into training base, generated by the naive bayes algorithm, and test base.
